### Master's project:
##### Disambiguating modality specific predictive coding through global field power
###### Abstract:
The human brain is known to exhibit a heightened mean voltage response approxi-
mately 300 milliseconds after an unexpected event, a phenomenon observable in EEG
readings. This response might reflect the underlying mechanisms of predictive cod-
ing, a theory in neuroscience that posits the brain as a predictor rather than a passive
receiver of sensory information. However, Global Field Power (GFP), a measure of
variability, has never been examined in the context of predictive coding. This study
sought to bridge this gap by analysing GFP levels in the pre-stimulus period to deter-
mine their predictive power regarding GFP levels at the P300 time frame post-stimulus.
Using a combination of EEG data and statistical analysis, the analysis revealed GFP
levels in pre-stimulus period can explain a portion of the variability on P300 GFP lev-
els with the help of linear models. These findings suggest that GFP levels could add to
the predictive coding phenomenon in EEG readings.
